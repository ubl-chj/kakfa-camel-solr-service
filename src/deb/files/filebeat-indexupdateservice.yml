      ### Multiline options

      # Mutiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
      # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

      # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with Date i.e.:2016-12-01 14:36:06
      #    multiline.pattern: "^[[:blank:]]+|^Caused"

      # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
      #    multiline.negate: true

      # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
      # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
      # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
      #    multiline.match: after

      # The maximum number of lines that are combined to one event.
      # In case there are more the max_lines the additional lines are discarded.
      # Default is 500
      # multiline.max_lines: 500

      # After the defined timeout, an multiline event is sent even if no new pattern was found to start a new event
      # Default is 5s.
      #multiline.timeout: 5s


      # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
      # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
      # exclude_lines. By default, no lines are dropped.
      exclude_lines: ["^(2[0-9]{3}(-[0-9]{2}){2} [0-9]{2}(:[0-9]{2}){2}.[0-9]{3} DEBUG)", "^(2[0-9]{3}(-[0-9]{2}){2} [0-9]{2}(:[0-9]{2}){2}.[0-9]{3}  INFO)", "^[[:blank:]]+|^Caused"]

  # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
  # exclude_lines. By default, all the lines are exported.
  #   include_lines: ["^(2[0-9]{3}(-[0-9]{2}){2} [0-9]{2}(:[0-9]{2}){2}.[0-9]{3} ERROR)", "^(2[0-9]{3}(-[0-9]{2}){2} [0-9]{2}(:[0-9]{2}){2}.[0-9]{3}  WARN)"]
